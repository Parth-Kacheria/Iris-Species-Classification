This project was created for an INSAID (International School of AI and Data Science) term project (Term 4 - Intermediate Machine Learning) to predict the species of the Iris Dataset

A brief overview of the project:
1. EDA
2. Train-Test-Split
3. Scaling of Data
4. Linear Regression
5. Logistic Regression
6. Regression using Decision Trees (including Gridsearch CV)
7. Regression using Random Forests (including Randomized Search CV)
8. Naive Bayes Classification
9. K Means Clustering
10. SVM Classification 
11. Model Evaluation
